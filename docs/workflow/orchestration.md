# Workflow Orchestration

Workflow orchestration in Datus Agent is the process of defining, managing, and executing sequences of nodes to accomplish data analysis tasks. This guide explains how workflows are structured, configured, and executed to transform natural language requests into SQL queries and results.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workflow Definition

A workflow is a sequence of nodes that:

- **Has a clear purpose**: Each workflow solves specific types of problems
- **Follows a logical order**: Nodes execute in a predefined sequence
- **Shares data**: Information flows between nodes through a shared context
- **Can be adaptive**: Some workflows can modify themselves during execution

### 2. Workflow Configuration

Datus provides several built-in workflow templates optimized for different use cases:

```yaml
workflow:
  reflection:
    - schema_linking
    - generate_sql
    - execute_sql
    - reflect
    - output

  fixed:
    - schema_linking
    - generate_sql
    - execute_sql
    - output

  metric_to_sql:
    - schema_linking
    - search_metrics
    - date_parser
    - generate_sql
    - execute_sql
    - output
```

**Note**: These are built-in workflow templates. To customize workflows or create your own, you need to configure them in `agent.yml` (see [Customizing Workflows](#customizing-workflows) section below).

## Built-in Workflow Types

### 1. Reflection Workflow

**Purpose**: Intelligent, self-improving SQL generation with adaptive behavior

**Node Sequence:**
```
Schema Linking → Generate SQL → Execute SQL → Reflect → Output
```

**Key Features:**

- **Self-assessment**: Reflect node evaluates results and decides next steps
- **Adaptive**: Can add new nodes dynamically based on execution results
- **Robust**: Handles complex queries that may require multiple attempts

**Best For:**

- Complex business queries
- Situations where perfect SQL isn't generated on first try
- Queries requiring domain knowledge

**Real-world Example:**

```
User: "Show me quarterly revenue trends by product category,
       excluding returns and considering seasonal adjustments"

Process:
1. Schema Linking: Finds orders, products, categories tables
2. Generate SQL: Creates initial quarterly revenue query
3. Execute SQL: Runs the query
4. Reflect: Notices missing seasonal adjustment logic
5. Add Fix Node: Corrects the query with seasonal calculations
6. Output: Final results with proper seasonal adjustments
```

### 2. Fixed Workflow

**Purpose**: Deterministic SQL generation with predictable execution path

**Node Sequence:**
```
Schema Linking → Generate SQL → Execute SQL → Output
```

**Key Features:**

- **Predictable**: Always follows the same execution path
- **Fast**: No reflection overhead
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and debug
- **Reliable**: Consistent behavior for well-understood problems

**Best For:**

- Simple, straightforward queries
- Well-defined data requirements
- Situations where you know exactly what you need
- Performance-critical applications

**Real-world Example:**

```
User: "List all customers from California"

Process:
1. Schema Linking: Finds customers table with state column
2. Generate SQL: Creates "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = 'CA'"
3. Execute SQL: Returns California customers
4. Output: Displays results
```

### 3. Metric-to-SQL Workflow

**Purpose**: Generate SQL from predefined business metrics

**Node Sequence:**
```
Schema Linking → Search Metrics → Date Parser → Generate SQL → Execute SQL → Output
```

**Key Features:**

- **Metric-driven**: Starts with business metrics rather than raw SQL
- **Time-aware**: Includes date parsing for temporal queries
- **Reusable**: Leverages existing metric definitions
- **Standardized**: Ensures consistent business calculations

**Best For:**

- Business intelligence and reporting
- Standardized KPI calculations
- Time-series analysis
- Dashboards and regular reports

**Real-world Example:**

```
User: "Show monthly active users for the last quarter"

Process:
1. Schema Linking: Finds user_activity table
2. Search Metrics: Finds "monthly_active_users" metric definition
3. Date Parser: Determines "last quarter" date range
4. Generate SQL: Creates query using the metric definition
5. Execute SQL: Runs the metric calculation
6. Output: Displays monthly active users by month
```

## Workflow Configuration

### Customizing Workflows

You can create custom workflow templates by adding them to your `agent.yml` configuration:

```yaml
agent:
  workflow:
    plan: custom_analytics  # Set your custom plan as default

    custom_analytics:
      - schema_linking
      - search_metrics
      - generate_sql
      - execute_sql
      - compare
      - output

    data_exploration:
      - schema_linking
      - doc_search
      - generate_sql
      - execute_sql
      - reflect
      - output
```

### Advanced Workflow Features

#### Parallel Execution

Workflows support parallel node execution for improved performance:

```yaml
agent:
  workflow:
    plan: bird_para

    bird_para:
      - schema_linking
      - parallel:
        - generate_sql
        - reasoning
      - selection
      - execute_sql
      - output
```

#### Sub-workflows

You can define reusable sub-workflows:

```yaml
agent:
  workflow:
    plan: main_workflow

    main_workflow:
      - schema_linking
      - parallel:
        - subworkflow1
        - subworkflow2
      - selection
      - execute_sql
      - output

    subworkflow1:
      - search_metrics
      - generate_sql

    subworkflow2:
      - search_metrics
      - reasoning
```

#### Sub-workflows with Custom Configuration

Sub-workflows can reference separate configuration files:

```yaml
agent:
  workflow:
    plan: multi_agent

    multi_agent:
      - schema_linking
      - parallel:
        - agent1_workflow
        - agent2_workflow
      - selection
      - output

    agent1_workflow:
      steps:
        - search_metrics
        - generate_sql
      config: multi/agent1.yaml

    agent2_workflow:
      steps:
        - reasoning
        - reflect
      config: multi/agent2.yaml
```

### Workflow Parameters

Workflows can be configured with parameters:

```bash
# Use specific workflow
datus run --database <your_namespace> --task "your query" --plan reflection

# Use custom workflow
datus run --database <your_namespace> --task "your query" --plan custom_analytics
```

### Available Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Options |
