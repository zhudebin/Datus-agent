# Metrics Generation Guide

## Overview

The metrics generation feature helps you convert SQL queries into reusable MetricFlow metric definitions. Using an AI assistant, you can analyze SQL business logic and automatically generate standardized YAML metric configurations that can be queried consistently across your organization.

## What is a Metric?

A **metric** is a reusable business calculation built on top of semantic models. Metrics provide:

- **Consistent Business Logic**: One definition, used everywhere
- **Type Safety**: Validated structure and measure references
- **Metadata**: Display names, formats, business context
- **Composability**: Build complex metrics from simpler ones

**Example**: Instead of writing `SELECT SUM(revenue) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)` repeatedly, define an `avg_customer_revenue` metric once.

## Important Limitations

**⚠️ Single Table Queries Only**

The current version **only supports generating metrics from single-table SQL queries**. Multi-table JOINs are not supported.

**Supported**:
```sql
SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM transactions WHERE status = 'completed'
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / COUNT(*) FROM orders
```

**Not Supported**:
```sql
SELECT SUM(o.amount)
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id  -- ❌ JOIN not supported
```

## How It Works

Start Datus CLI with `datus --database <namespace>`, and use the metrics generation subagent:

```bash
/gen_metrics Generate a metric from this SQL: SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions, the coresponding question is total amount of all transactions
```

### Generation Workflow

```
User provides SQL and question → Agent analyzes logic → Finds semantic model → Reads measures →
Checks for duplicates → Generates metric YAML → Appends to file → Validates →
User confirms → Syncs to Knowledge Base
```

### Interactive Confirmation

After generation, you'll see:

```
==========================================================
Generated YAML: transactions.yml
Path: /Users/you/.datus/data/semantic_models/transactions.yml
==========================================================
[YAML content with syntax highlighting showing the new metric]

  SYNC TO KNOWLEDGE BASE?

  1. Yes - Save to Knowledge Base
  2. No - Keep file only

Please enter your choice: [1/2]
```

**Options:**
- **Option 1**: Syncs the metric to your Knowledge Base for AI-powered semantic search
- **Option 2**: Keeps the YAML file only without syncing to the Knowledge Base

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration

Most configurations are built-in. In `agent.yml`, minimal setup is needed:

```yaml
agentic_nodes:
  gen_metrics:
    model: claude        # Optional: defaults to configured model
    max_turns: 40        # Optional: defaults to 30
```

**Built-in configurations** (automatically enabled):
- **Tools**: Generation tools and filesystem tools
- **Hooks**: User confirmation workflow in interactive mode
- **MCP Server**: MetricFlow validation server
- **System Prompt**: Built-in template version 1.0
- **Workspace**: `~/.datus/data/{namespace}/semantic_models`

### Configuration Options

| Parameter | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `model` | No | LLM model to use | Uses default configured model |
| `max_turns` | No | Maximum conversation turns | 30 |

### Subject Tree Categorization

Subject tree allows organizing metrics by domain and layers for better management. In CLI mode, include it in your question:

**Example with subject_tree:**
```text
/gen_metrics Generate a metric from this SQL: SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions, subject_tree: finance/revenue/transactions
```

**Example without subject_tree:**
```text
/gen_metrics Generate a metric from this SQL: SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions
```

When subject_tree is provided, the metric will be categorized accordingly (e.g., domain: finance, layer1: revenue, layer2: transactions). If not provided, the agent operates in learning mode and may suggest categories based on existing metrics in the Knowledge Base.



## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Aggregation

**User Input**:
```text
/gen_metrics Generate a metric for total order count
```

**Agent Actions**:
1. Finds `orders.yml` semantic model
2. Reads file to discover `order_count` measure
3. Generates simple metric:

```yaml
---
metric:
  name: total_orders
  description: Total number of orders
  type: simple
  type_params:
    measure: order_count
  locked_metadata:
    display_name: "Total Orders"
    increase_is_good: true
```

### Example 2: Revenue Metric

**User Input**:
```
/gen_metrics Create a metric from this SQL:
SELECT SUM(amount) as total_revenue FROM transactions WHERE status = 'completed'
```

**Agent Actions**:
1. Analyzes SQL aggregation (SUM with filter)
2. Finds or creates `transactions.yml` semantic model
3. Generates simple metric:

```yaml
---
metric:
  name: total_revenue
  description: Total revenue from completed transactions
  type: simple
  type_params:
    measure: total_amount
  filter: "status = 'completed'"
  locked_metadata:
    display_name: "Total Revenue"
    value_format: "$,.2f"
    increase_is_good: true
```

### Example 3: Count Metric

**User Input**:
```text
/gen_metrics Generate unique customer count metric:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM orders
```

**Agent Actions**:
1. Locates `orders.yml` semantic model
2. Identifies COUNT DISTINCT aggregation
3. Generates simple metric:

```yaml
---
metric:
  name: unique_customer_count
  description: Total number of unique customers
  type: simple
  type_params:
    measure: unique_customers
  locked_metadata:
    display_name: "Unique Customers"
    increase_is_good: true
```

## How Metrics Are Stored

### File Organization

Metrics are stored in separate files from semantic models:

- **Semantic Model**: `{table_name}.yml` - Contains data_source definition with measures and dimensions
- **Metrics**: `metrics/{table_name}_metrics.yml` - Contains metric definitions

**Semantic Model File** (`transactions.yml`):
```yaml
data_source:
  name: transactions
  sql_table: transactions
  measures:
    - name: revenue
      agg: SUM
      expr: amount
    - name: transaction_count
      agg: COUNT
      expr: "1"
  dimensions:
    - name: transaction_date
      type: TIME
```

**Metrics File** (`metrics/transactions_metrics.yml`):
```yaml
metric:
  name: total_revenue
  description: Total revenue from all transactions
  type: simple
  type_params:
    measure: revenue

---
metric:
  name: total_transactions
  description: Total number of transactions
  type: simple
  type_params:
    measure: transaction_count
```

**Why separate files?**
- Clear separation between schema definitions and business metrics
- Easier to manage metrics independently
- Multiple metrics use YAML document separator `---` within the metrics file

### Knowledge Base Storage

When you choose "1. Yes - Save to Knowledge Base", the metric is stored in a Vector Database with:

1. **Metadata**: Name, description, type, domain/layer classification
2. **LLM Text**: Natural language representation for semantic search
3. **References**: Associated semantic model name
4. **Timestamp**: Creation date
