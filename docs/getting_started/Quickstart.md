# Quickstart

Get started with Datus Agent in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through installation, setup, and your first interactions with Datus.

!!! tip "Need the full warehouse workflow?"
    For an end-to-end example that covers layered warehouse design, ETL generation, Airflow scheduling, semantic assets, and Superset dashboards, see [Data Engineering Quickstart](./data_engineering_quickstart.md).

## Step 1: Installation & Setup

### Option A — One-liner (Linux / macOS, recommended)

Stable install from PyPI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datus-ai/datus-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

Dev install from GitHub source (unreleased changes on `main`, or any branch/tag/commit):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datus-ai/datus-agent/main/install-dev.sh | sh
# or pin to a specific ref
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datus-ai/datus-agent/main/install-dev.sh | DATUS_REF=feature/foo sh
```

Both scripts bootstrap `uv`, create a dedicated venv at `~/.datus/venv` (Python 3.12 is downloaded automatically if missing), and write `datus`, `datus-cli`, `datus-api`, `datus-mcp`, `datus-agent`, `datus-gateway`, and `datus-pip` shims into `~/.local/bin`. Open a new shell (or `source ~/.zshrc`) so the new PATH takes effect.

To install additional Python packages into the global venv later, use:

```bash
datus-pip install <package>
# equivalent to ~/.datus/venv/bin/pip install <package>
```

Pin a released version with the stable installer — note the variable is passed to the receiving shell, not to `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datus-ai/datus-agent/main/install.sh | DATUS_VERSION=0.2.6 sh
```

Other variables supported by both scripts: `DATUS_HOME`, `DATUS_BIN_DIR`, `DATUS_FORCE=1`, `DATUS_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1`.

Once the script finishes, skip the rest of this step and go straight to **Configure LLM & Database** below.

### Option B — Manual install

#### Install Python 3.12

Datus requires a Python 3.12 environment. Choose your preferred method:

=== "Conda"

    ```bash
    conda create -n datus python=3.12
    conda activate datus
    ```

=== "virtualenv"

    ```bash
    virtualenv datus --python=python3.12
    source datus/bin/activate
    ```

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Install Datus Agent

!!! note
    Please ensure that your pip version is compatible with Python 3.12.

    To upgrade pip, you can use:
    ```bash
    python -m ensurepip --upgrade
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    ```

=== "Stable Release"

    ```bash
    pip install datus-agent
    ```

=== "Beta Release"

    ```bash
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ datus-agent
    ```

### Configure LLM & Database

Run the configuration command to set up your LLM provider and database connections:

```bash
datus-agent configure
```

This interactive tool lets you:

**1. Add a Model** — Select your LLM provider (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, Kimi, Qwen, etc.) and enter your API key. Environment variables like `${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}` are auto-detected.

**2. Add a Database** — Connect to your database. For a quick start, use the demo DuckDB:

!!! tip "Demo Database"
    Datus provides a pre-configured demo DuckDB database for testing.

    **Connection string:** `~/.datus/sample/duckdb-demo.duckdb`

Database adapter plugins (Snowflake, MySQL, PostgreSQL, StarRocks) are auto-installed when selected.

Configuration is saved to `~/.datus/conf/agent.yml`. Run `datus-agent configure` again anytime to add more models or databases.

#### Built-in model providers in the configuration wizard

The current wizard includes these providers out of the box:

| Provider | Typical models | Auth | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openai` | `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-4.1`, `o3` | API key with `OPENAI_API_KEY` auto-detection | General chat, reasoning, tool use |
| `deepseek` | `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner` | API key with `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` auto-detection | Cost-effective reasoning and SQL generation |
| `claude` | `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-5` | API key with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auto-detection | Long context and complex reasoning |
| `kimi` | `kimi-k2.5`, `kimi-k2-thinking` | API key with `KIMI_API_KEY` auto-detection | Chinese-heavy workloads and long context |
| `qwen` | `qwen3-max`, `qwen3-coder-plus` | API key with `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` auto-detection | Chinese workloads, general chat, coding |
| `gemini` | `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro` | API key with `GEMINI_API_KEY` auto-detection | Large-context analysis |
| `minimax` | `MiniMax-M2.7`, `MiniMax-M2.5` | API key | General reasoning |
| `glm` | `glm-5`, `glm-4.7` | API key | Chinese workloads and tool-calling |

There are also two special auth flows:

| Provider | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude_subscription` | Claude subscription token | The wizard first tries to auto-detect a local Claude subscription credential, then falls back to manual token input |

!!! note
    `codex` still appears in the provider catalog, but the current `datus-agent configure` flow is not ready to set it up end-to-end yet. Do not rely on it as a working interactive wizard option for now.

#### What are Coding Plan providers

The wizard also includes coding/plan-oriented providers. These use Anthropic-compatible endpoints, but from Datus's perspective they are configured just like any other model entry in `agent.models`.

| Provider | Default model | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `alibaba_coding` | `qwen3-coder-plus` | One coding endpoint that can serve Qwen / GLM / Kimi / MiniMax models |
| `glm_coding` | `glm-5` | GLM coding endpoint |
| `minimax_coding` | `MiniMax-M2.7` | MiniMax coding endpoint |
| `kimi_coding` | `kimi-for-coding` | Kimi coding endpoint |

These are a good fit when:

- You want the default model to lean toward planning, coding, or structured decomposition
- You use [Plan Mode](../cli/plan_mode.md) frequently for multi-step tasks
- You want to separate general-purpose chat models from coding/plan models and bind them to different nodes later

!!! tip "Environment variables and model overrides"
    For OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, Kimi, Qwen, and Gemini, the wizard can prompt with provider-specific environment variable hints.

    For `minimax`, `glm`, and the `*_coding` providers, you can still enter environment-variable references directly, such as `${MINIMAX_API_KEY}`, `${GLM_API_KEY}`, `${KIMI_API_KEY}`, or `${DASHSCOPE_API_KEY}`.

    The current implementation also auto-applies required parameter overrides for some models, such as `kimi-k2.5` and `qwen3-coder-plus`.

### Initialize Project (Optional)

In your project directory, run:

```bash
datus-agent init
```

This generates an `AGENTS.md` file describing your project's architecture, directory structure, services, and data assets. The LLM analyzes your directory and README to produce the content.

You can also use `--database` to include database schema information:

```bash
datus-agent init --database demo
```

## Step 2: Launch Datus CLI

Start the Datus CLI with your configured database:

!!! tip "Multiple Databases"
    You can add more databases anytime with `datus-agent configure`. Use `datus-agent service list` to see all configured databases.

```bash title="Terminal"
datus-cli --database duckdb-demo
```
```{ .yaml .no-copy }

```

## Step 3: Start Using Datus

!!! tip
    You can execute SQL in Datus just like in a SQL editor.

List all tables:

```bash title="Terminal"
Datus> .tables
```
```{ .yaml .no-copy }

!!! tip
    To chat, start a line with `/` and continue in natural language.

Suppose we want to understand the correlation between gold and Bitcoin. We can ask the Datus agent directly:

```bash title="Terminal"
Datus> /Detailed analysis of gold–Bitcoin correlation.
```

Datus will display its thinking process to show how it approaches the task, then provide a detailed report.

                                                              🎯 Key Insights

                                                       1. Weak Negative Correlation

    The -0.225 correlation suggests these assets tend to move in opposite directions more often than together, though the relationship
    is weak.

                                                       2. Similar Movement Patterns

    Both assets show remarkably similar movement patterns:

    • Approximately 44% of the time they move in the same direction
    • Approximately 40% of the time they move in opposite directions

                                                         3. Volatility Comparison

    Bitcoin shows slightly higher volatility (0.233) compared to Gold (0.200), which aligns with Bitcoin's reputation as a more
    volatile asset.

                                                       4. Risk-Adjusted Performance

    • Gold Sharpe Ratio: 3.42
    • Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio: 3.37 Both assets show strong risk-adjusted returns during this period.


                                                               ⚠️ Limitations

    This analysis is based on a very short time window (15 minutes of data). For more robust correlation analysis, data spanning
    multiple days/weeks would be needed to observe:

    • Longer-term correlation trends
    • Market regime changes
    • Impact of macroeconomic events
    • Seasonal patterns


                                                        💡 Investment Implications

    The weak negative correlation suggests these assets could provide some diversification benefits, though the relationship is not
    strong enough for reliable hedging strategies based on this limited dataset.

### Context Management

!!! note
    If you have initialized the knowledge base for metadata.

If you want to add items such as a file, metric or table to the context, use `@`. Manual retrieval gives the LLM more precise context, narrows the search scope, and improves answer accuracy.

```bash title="Terminal"
Datus> /@Table duckdb-demo.main.bank_failures
```

Datus will automatically analyze the table and add metadata to the context.
