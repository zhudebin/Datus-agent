# Datus-CLI User Manual

## Overview

Datus-CLI is a data engineering agent that builds evolvable context for your data system. It combines the power of AI with a modern TUI experience to enhance SQL development efficiency.

## Quick Start

```bash
# SQLite
#python cli/main.py --db_type sqlite --db_path benchmark/bird/dev_20240627/dev_databases/california_schools/california_schools.sqlite
python cli/main.py --namespace bird_sqlite  --config conf/agent.yml

# Snowflake
#python cli/main.py --db-type snowflake --sf-account your_account --sf-user your_user --sf-password your_password --sf-warehouse your_warehouse --sf-database your_database 
python cli/main.py --namespace spidersnow  --config conf/agent.yml
```
And then run sqls as you wish. 

## Examples to explore bird benchmark

```bash
python main.py bootstrap-kb --benchmark bird_dev --namespace bird_sqlite --kb_update_strategy overwrite

```

1. Natural Language Query:
```sql
Datus> !dastart
Creating a new SQL task
Enter task description (): How many schools in merged Alameda have number of test takers less than 100?
Enter database name (benchmark/bird/dev_20240627/dev_databases/california_schools/california_schools.sqlite): california_schools
Enter output directory (output): 
Enter external knowledge (optional) (): 
```

2. Table Exploration:
```sql
.tables
```

3. schema linking
```sql
Datus> !sl
Node Type: SCHEMA_LINKING
Node Input:
SchemaLinkingInput(
    input_text='How many schools in merged Alameda have number of test takers less than 100?',
    top_n=5,
    database_type='sqlite',
    database_name='california_schools',
    matching_rate='fast',
    sql_context=None
)
Do you want to execute this node? [y/n] (y): 
```

4. SQL Generation:
```sql
Datus> !gen
Node Type: GENERATE_SQL
Node Input:
GenerateSQLInput(
    database_type='sqlite',
    table_schemas=[
        TableSchema(
            table_name='schools',
            database_name='california_schools',
            schema_name='',
            schema_text="
... 670-4590,,www.acoe.org,1980-07-01,,0.0,,,00,County Office of Education (COE),10,County Community,COMM,County Community School,HS,High 
School,K-12,7-12,P,0.0,37.658212,-122.09713,Carolyn,Hobbs,chobbs@acoe.org,,,,,,,2016-10-06\n',
            created_at='2025-05-13T05:07:45.689786'
        )
    ],
    metrics=[],
    input_text='How many schools in merged Alameda have number of test takers less than 100?',
    contexts=[],
    external_knowledge=''
)
Do you want to execute this node? [y/n] (y): 
Executing GENERATE_SQL node...
Node Result:
GenerateSQLResult(
    success=True,
    error=None,
    sql_query="SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfSchools FROM satscores WHERE cname = 'Alameda' AND NumTstTakr < 100 AND rtype = 'S';",
    tables=['satscores'],
    explanation="The question asks for the count of schools in Alameda with fewer than 100 test takers. The 'satscores' table contains the relevant data, including the county name 
('cname'), the number of test takers ('NumTstTakr'), and the record type ('rtype') which distinguishes between different types of records (e.g., 'S' for school). The query filters for 
records where the county is Alameda, the number of test takers is less than 100, and the record type is 'S' (school), then counts these records."
)
Context updated successfully
```

5. Run sql
```sql
Datus> !run
Running SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfSchools FROM satscores WHERE cname = 'Alameda' AND NumTstTakr < 100 AND rtype = 'S';
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ NumberOfSchools ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ 45              │
└─────────────────┘
Returned 1 rows in 0.01 seconds
```

6. Chat with AI:
````sql
Datus> / Can you explain this query's performance?
# SQL Query Performance Explanation

The query you executed is performing well for several reasons:

## Efficient Query Structure
- **Simple COUNT operation**: Counting rows is generally efficient in SQLite as it can use indexes without retrieving full rows.
- **Clear filtering conditions**: The WHERE clause has three specific filters (`cname`, `NumTstTakr`, `rtype`).

## Performance Factors
1. **Index Utilization**: 
   - If there are indexes on `cname`, `NumTstTakr`, or `rtype`, the query will be very fast.
   - Without indexes, SQLite must scan the entire table but can still perform efficiently for moderate-sized tables.

2. **Filter Selectivity**:
   - The combination of filters likely reduces the result set significantly before counting.
   - `rtype = 'S'` probably filters to just schools (excluding districts or other types).

3. **Small Result Set**:
   - The query returns just one number (45), minimizing data transfer.

## Potential Improvements
- If this query runs frequently, ensure indexes exist on the filtered columns:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_satscores_filter ON satscores(cname, NumTstTakr, rtype);
  ```
- For very large tables, consider materialized views if this count is needed often.

The query appears optimal for its purpose - it's simple, specific, and returns minimal data. The execution was successful with no errors reported.

7. End the workflow:
```sql
Datus> !save

Do you want to execute this node? [y/n] (y): 
Executing OUTPUT node...
Node Result:
OutputResult(success=True, error=None, output='02bd515a.csv', sql_query='', sql_result='')
Context updated successfully

Datus> !bash ls output
02bd515a.csv
Datus> !bash cat output/02bd515a.csv
...

Datus> !daend

## Command Types

Datus-CLI supports several types of commands, each with its own prefix:

### 1. Tool Commands (!)

Tool commands are used for AI-powered SQL generation and workflow execution:
