# Grafana Dashboard Skill

This skill defines the workflow for creating and managing dashboards in Grafana.

## Key Differences from Superset

- Grafana charts (panels) embed SQL queries directly — no separate "dataset" concept.
- Panels belong to dashboards — `dashboard_id` is **required** for `create_chart`.
- The datasource is auto-resolved from the `datasource_name` configuration.
- `update_chart` is **not supported** — delete and recreate the panel instead.

## Dashboard Creation Workflow

Follow these steps **in order**.

### Step 1: Materialize Data (`write_query`)

Run the analytical SQL on the **source database** and write results to **Grafana's dataset database**.

```python
write_query(sql="SELECT ... FROM source_table ...", table_name="materialized_table_name")
```

- The SQL runs on the source (datasource) database.
- Results are written as a physical table in Grafana's dataset database (configured in `dataset_db`).
- **CRITICAL**: Remember the `table_name` — you will query this table in Step 3.

### Step 2: Create Dashboard (`create_dashboard`)

Create the dashboard first — Grafana requires `dashboard_id` to add panels.

```python
create_dashboard(title="Dashboard Title", description="Optional description")
```

Returns `dashboard_id` — save it for Step 3.

### Step 3: Create Charts (`create_chart`)

Create panels with SQL that queries the **materialized table** from Step 1.

```python
create_chart(
    chart_type="line",           # bar, line, pie, table, big_number, scatter
    title="Chart Title",
    sql="SELECT date_col AS time, value_col FROM materialized_table_name ORDER BY date_col",
    dashboard_id="<from step 2>"
)
```

**CRITICAL RULES for the `sql` parameter:**
- The SQL must query tables in the **dataset database** (written by `write_query`), NOT the source database.
- For time series charts: alias the time column as `time` (e.g., `SELECT date_col AS time, ...`).
- For table charts: use descriptive column aliases (e.g., `SELECT date AS "Date", count AS "Count"`).
- Always include `ORDER BY` for time series data.
- The datasource is automatically resolved — do not worry about datasource configuration.

**DO NOT** write SQL like `SELECT ... FROM source_db_table` — this will fail because the Grafana datasource points to the dataset database, not the source database.

### Multiple Charts

Repeat Step 3 for each chart. All panels use the same `dashboard_id`.

For charts needing different data shapes, run additional `write_query` calls in Step 1 to create multiple materialized tables.

### Step 4: Validate the Published Dashboard (`bi-validation`)

After creating the dashboard and panels, load `bi-validation` and verify:

- the dashboard exists and is reachable via `get_dashboard`
- the expected panels appear via `list_charts`
- each panel can be inspected via `get_chart(chart_id, dashboard_id)`
- panel titles and chart types match the intended configuration
- panel SQL points at the materialized tables and uses the correct time alias when required
- the configuration check covers every panel on the dashboard
- `get_chart_data` is not available in Grafana yet, so report the data check as unsupported / N/A unless you have a separate reference query or known expected values

Do not report success until this validation pass completes.

## Viewing & Querying

| Action | Tool | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| List dashboards | `list_dashboards(search="keyword")` | Filter by keyword |
| Get dashboard details | `get_dashboard(dashboard_id="...")` | Full info including panels |
| List charts in dashboard | `list_charts(dashboard_id="...")` | All panels with SQL |
| Get chart details | `get_chart(chart_id="...", dashboard_id="...")` | Full panel metadata; dashboard_id required in Grafana |
| List datasources | `list_datasets()` | Grafana datasources |

## Updating

- **Update dashboard**: `update_dashboard(dashboard_id, title="New Title", description="New desc")`
- **Update chart**: Not supported in Grafana. Delete the chart and create a new one instead.

## Deleting

**MUST confirm with user before any deletion.**

- `delete_dashboard(dashboard_id="...")`
- `delete_chart(chart_id="...")`

## Important Rules

1. **Always `write_query` first** — Grafana panels query the dataset database, not the source database. Skipping this step causes "No data" errors.
2. **Chart SQL must reference materialized tables** — never use source database table names in `create_chart(sql=...)`.
3. **`dashboard_id` is required** for `create_chart` — create the dashboard before creating charts.
4. **Time series**: Alias the time column as `time` for Grafana to recognize it.
5. **Language**: Match the user's language (Chinese input -> Chinese output).
6. **Stat/big_number panels**: Use a single aggregation query like `SELECT COUNT(*) AS value FROM table`.
